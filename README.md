# FE Take-Home

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with the Typescript template. Assumptions: the project will not grow significantly (so I used context instead of something fancier like Redux); the requirements for the project were absolute (I wanted to add an "empty jar" function, but since it was not in the list of requirements, I did not add it).
